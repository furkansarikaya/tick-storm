# Security Patch Management

## Overview

This document defines the security patch management process for TickStorm to ensure timely application of security patches and maintenance of security posture.

## Security Patch Prioritization Framework

### Priority Levels

#### 🔥 Critical (< 24 hours)
- **CVSS Score**: 9.0 - 10.0
- **Impact**: Remote code execution, privilege escalation, data breach
- **Examples**: Zero-day exploits, active exploitation in the wild
- **Response**: Immediate emergency deployment

#### 🔴 High (< 72 hours)
- **CVSS Score**: 7.0 - 8.9
- **Impact**: Significant security vulnerability with potential for exploitation
- **Examples**: Authentication bypass, SQL injection, XSS
- **Response**: Expedited deployment within 3 days

#### 🟡 Medium (< 2 weeks)
- **CVSS Score**: 4.0 - 6.9
- **Impact**: Moderate security risk with limited impact
- **Examples**: Information disclosure, DoS vulnerabilities
- **Response**: Regular maintenance window deployment

#### 🟢 Low (< 1 month)
- **CVSS Score**: 0.1 - 3.9
- **Impact**: Low security risk with minimal impact
- **Examples**: Minor information leaks, low-impact DoS
- **Response**: Scheduled maintenance deployment

## Emergency Security Patch Deployment Process

### Emergency Response Team
- **Primary**: Lead Developer
- **Secondary**: DevOps Engineer  
- **Escalation**: Security Team Lead

### Emergency Deployment Pipeline

#### Phase 1: Assessment (0-2 hours)
1. **Vulnerability Analysis**
   - Impact assessment using CVSS calculator
   - Exploitability evaluation
   - Asset inventory check

2. **Risk Evaluation**
   - Business impact analysis
   - Customer data exposure risk
   - Service availability impact

#### Phase 2: Patch Development (2-8 hours)
1. **Patch Identification**
   - Vendor patch availability check
   - Custom patch development if needed
   - Dependency update requirements

2. **Testing Protocol**
   - Automated test suite execution
   - Security-specific test cases
   - Performance regression testing

#### Phase 3: Emergency Deployment (8-24 hours)
1. **Staging Deployment**
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Smoke testing execution
   - Security validation

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Blue-green deployment strategy
   - Real-time monitoring activation
   - Rollback preparation

### Emergency Deployment Commands
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Emergency patch deployment script

PATCH_VERSION=$1
EMERGENCY_REASON=$2

echo "🚨 EMERGENCY PATCH DEPLOYMENT: $PATCH_VERSION"
echo "Reason: $EMERGENCY_REASON"

# Build emergency patch
docker build -t tickstorm:$PATCH_VERSION-emergency .

# Deploy to staging
kubectl set image deployment/tickstorm-staging tickstorm=tickstorm:$PATCH_VERSION-emergency

# Wait for staging validation
kubectl rollout status deployment/tickstorm-staging --timeout=300s

# Deploy to production with immediate rollback capability
kubectl set image deployment/tickstorm-prod tickstorm=tickstorm:$PATCH_VERSION-emergency

# Monitor deployment
kubectl rollout status deployment/tickstorm-prod --timeout=600s

echo "✅ Emergency patch deployed successfully"
```

## Security Testing Protocols

### Pre-Deployment Security Tests

#### Automated Security Test Suite
```go
// internal/security/security_test.go
package security

import (
    "testing"
    "crypto/tls"
    "net/http"
)

func TestTLSConfiguration(t *testing.T) {
    // Test TLS 1.3 enforcement
    client := &http.Client{
        Transport: &http.Transport{
            TLSClientConfig: &tls.Config{
                MaxVersion: tls.VersionTLS12, // Should fail
            },
        },
    }
    
    _, err := client.Get("https://localhost:8080/health")
    if err == nil {
        t.Error("Expected TLS 1.2 connection to fail")
    }
}

func TestAuthenticationBypass(t *testing.T) {
    // Test authentication bypass attempts
    testCases := []struct {
        name     string
        username string
        password string
        expected bool
    }{
        {"Empty credentials", "", "", false},
        {"SQL injection", "admin'; --", "password", false},
        {"Path traversal", "../admin", "password", false},
    }
    
    for _, tc := range testCases {
        t.Run(tc.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            result := authenticateUser(tc.username, tc.password)
            if result != tc.expected {
                t.Errorf("Expected %v, got %v", tc.expected, result)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

#### Security Regression Tests
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/security-regression-test.sh

echo "🔒 Running security regression tests..."

# TLS configuration tests
echo "Testing TLS configuration..."
nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 8080 localhost

# Authentication tests
echo "Testing authentication mechanisms..."
go test -v ./internal/auth/... -tags=security

# Input validation tests
echo "Testing input validation..."
go test -v ./internal/protocol/... -tags=security

# Network security tests
echo "Testing network security..."
go test -v ./internal/server/... -tags=security

echo "✅ Security regression tests completed"
```
